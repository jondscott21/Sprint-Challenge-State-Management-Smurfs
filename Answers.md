it helps you avoid accessive prop drilling

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role 
in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?

store handles global state for redux, actions sort which part of the reducers actions are going to and reducer handles state changes

appclication state is used in multiple components and component state just locally

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?

allows you to pass a function into your action creator

1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!

i definitely like reducers since it centralizes your logic
